# GWigWam_WormsEvo
The evolution of two simple species.

Hobby project I created a few years back (+/- 2012), not under active development.

See [release.zip](release.zip) for a compiled version. To run:

 - Extract all the files in the .zip
 - Run the WormsEvo.jar file
 - Press `R` or `G` to spawn 'red' or 'green' worms.
 - Press `space` or `up` / `down` to change game speed.
